# A Super simple vulnerable website about cool pandas

A very simple NodeJS and React.JS website that provides a very cool website about pandas, but it doesn't
seem to be very secure...?

## Docker Setup

- Install Docker Desktop (and make sure it is running)
- Navigate to "NodeJS" folder
- Run `docker compose up -d`
- To shutdown run `docker compose down`
- Navigate to "http://localhost:3000" in your web browswer to see the many cool pandas!

## Development Environment Setup

- Make sure Node/NPM is installed ([Windows Install](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-node-js-npm-on-windows))
- Open a terminal/CMD window and navigate to the "NodeJS" folder
- Run "npm install" to install all of the required dependencies
- Then run "npm start" to start the backend (don't close this window)
- Open another terminal/CMD and navigate to the "ReactUI" folder inside the "NodeJS" folder
- Run "npm install" there aswell
- Then run "npm start"

## (OUTDATED) Setup

- Make sure node is installed
- Run "npm install" in the root folder
- Navigate into the "ReactUI" folder
- Run "npm install" again in this folder
- Go back to the root folder and run "npm start"
